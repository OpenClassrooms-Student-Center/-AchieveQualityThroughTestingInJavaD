# Helpful JUnit Annotations
## Supporting JUnit4 Examples

* You can run the tests with `clean mvn test`
* These examples are fully described in my Openclassrooms course on testing in Java.
* Run just the conversion tests with `mvn -Dgroups 'com.openclassrooms.testing.Categories$ConversionTests' test`
* *Don't forget the quotes around the class name or the $ might mean something completely different on your command line*
