* You can run the tests with `mvn clean test`
* These examples are fully described in my Openclassrooms course on testing in Java.
* Run just the conversion tests with `mvn -Dgroups='com.openclassrooms.testing.Categories$ConversionTests' test`
* *Don't forget the quotes around the class name or the $ might mean something completely different on your command line*!
* *Have a look at the incomplete `convert` method in  `Calculator.java`. Can you TDD converting Celsius to Fahrenheit?
